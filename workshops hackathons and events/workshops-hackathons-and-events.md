# Workshops (non academia term) Hackathons and events

Here you will find documentation of how workshop plans, agendas and focuses have been developed and adapted by the team members working on 'Better UX for Scietific OSS'

## Focus of workshops

To invite those working on scientific and research OSS to learn more about design, User Experience (UX), user research, User Interface (UI), Usability and other aspects of 'design' (broadly defined), in order to make 'better' scientific OSS software.

People included:
- Academics & Researchers
- People based in'labs' either university, institution or other affiliated places
- RSE's (Research SOftware Engineers)
- PI's (Principle Investigators)
- Scientific/Research OSS maintainers
- Tool teams building Scientific/Research OSS
- Scientists
- Designers within the Scientific/Research OSS space
- OSPO members (Open Source Program Office)
- Employees of companies and/or organisations that make contributions to maintaining Scientific/Research OSS


**The general focus of the workshops is to:**
1. Understand what balance of hands-on, coding in UI frameworks (STRUDEL Kit) as well as background Design/UX/UI thepory and exploration helps enable better, clearer and more positive user-centered experience decisions in Scientific/Research OSS by those that create and maintain Scientific/Research OSS.
2. What structure works best for workshops/hackathons/events for are main audiences (listed above) and how is any existing design/UX/UI/Usability related content best adapted and augmented in order to serve these audiences better.
3. Create open source resources for and from these workshops/hackathons/events that have clear open documentationa nd guidance so that others may use (and 'peer review') these resource and submit upstream pull requests for adaption to the resources and format into the future.)
4. Understand, develop, adapt and improve UI kits and UI frameworks for better and more appropriate usage by Scientific/Research OSS and those that build and maintain Scientific/Research OSS.
5. Build community of software devs, RSE's, designers and other applicable and relevant audiences to learn, develop and hold space for better design, UX and UI in Scientific/Research OSS (post this specific funding grant timeline)


## Jan 27th MIT Hackathon

On January the 27th of 2025 a combination of the team working on this project travelled to Boston MIT to deliver a workshop/hackathon/event on the MIT campus for RSE's and other related audience members that had a split 50/50 focus on design as a form of understanding strategy, users and purpose of a tool/technology and half a hands-on practical session getting [STRUDEL Kit](https://strudel.science/) running on participants local machines and then progressing through adding a task flow, adding data and adapting a task flow.

**Learnings**

- Some attendees will arrive and stay in a 'solutions' focussed mode throughout the workshop, which can sometimes render the exercises in the UX design/strategy sections repetative and 'slow' as it doesn't visualise solutions in the form of UI/technology immediately.
**Recommend** stress testing all exercises against a repetative attendee and explain/model examples to be non-repeatative.

- Front loading all explorative, strategical and design thinking exercises helps attendees to prepare what they want to prototype/model in STRUDEL, but that can mean the technical aspects of getting set up with STRUDEL become difficult for the attention span. 
**Recommend** alternating strategical and dev/coding tasks throughout the workshop/hackathon/event time to retain maximum attention and switching between screen-based work and paper-based work.

- Some attendees needed support to understand what was available in STRUDEL's taskflow UI 'kit' in order to 'sketch out' options and felt nervous strating from scratch with sketching. 
**Recommend** having some paper based examples/printouts to show possibilities and encourage sketching around 'fill in the blank' UI layouts for common Scientific/Research OSS and having more examples generally of low-fidelity to high-fidelity visuals to support creatiove thinking from attendees.

- Attendees were informed that a Figma design file existed for those not ready to do development/server environment set-up, but being 'messy' in a structured Figma file may not be at the comfort level of many intended audience types.
**Recommendations similar to above**

- Due to the smaller number of present attendees, all were able to share their work and process openly to the room and gain considerable feedback on their ideas and process from multiple perspectives. This high-value time with the facilitators of both Design and STRUDEL aspects of the workshop enabled the attendees to specifically tailor and focus their needs and results with the facilitators expert guideance. 
**Recommend** ensuring that enough faciltators familiar with design, UX and strategical exercises as well as those with a deep understanding of the capabilities of STRUDEL Kit are present to work alongside attendees espeically when attendeenumbers are in the 20+ mark.


## Preparation for the next workshop/events/hackathons

We are planning to attend University of Vermont's research week event on the week starting the 21st of April in Burlington, Vermont. 

We have been offered two 2 hour slots in order to offer STRUDEL and Better Design workshop content and have the possibilities of extending into an evening, post the programmed event and also considering a remote sprint and/or support mechnanisms for attendees post the 2 hour allocated time slot. This also include considering what online/remote options there are simultaneously for this event.


## Suggestions on activities to test in workshops/events/hackathons

From [Mike Morrison](https://bsky.app/profile/mikemorrison.bsky.social) of https://www.better.science/

1. The science of how visual attention works. How to guide peopleâ€™s eyes through a hierarchy of content with cited references.
 - Activity type: Visual hierarchy: Put 1,2,3,4 on a google slide in random spots. Attendees all pick a slide and try to use the scientific principles of visual attention to make people look at those areas of the slide in the 'right' order. To 'score', call on other participants to yell out what they see first, second, third, etc. on the other person's slide.
2. Emotional design. Understand what huamn emotions and connection their are to a design, content or tool. 
	- List some adjectives that describe your last finding. Now try to find the subtle 'feel' of those. Try to represent that emotion on a slide without resorting to photos alone. Using position, shapes, scribbles. Now up-translate into fonts, photos, etc. Best case then end up with a mood board for their research's 'brand'.
3. Learning (as a user) while comprehending a UI or interface. 
	- Pick one person to read slides out loud as the speaker is talking, to show much insane learning interference is created when text and speakers' words don't match.
4. Boredom vs. consistency vs. explorative modes for users.
	- Design a small slide deck to be intentionally boring, and then suddenly make it engaging again. No bullet points allowed in boring condition, because that's cheating.
5. How users conceptulise a 'goal' when using software.
