### What is design? (in the context of science & OSS)

**Paper:** https://cc.oulu.fi/~mrajanen/OSS2015_rajanen_iivari.pdf
**Quote:** *It seems that there may be a cultural clash or conflict between usability work and engineering culture as well as between usability work and culture of some particular development organizations. To solve the problem of cultural clash or conflict, researchers suggest that: 1) Usability work should be modified to fit the engineering culture; 2) Usability work should be modified to fit some particular organizational culture; 3) Engineering culture should be modified so that usability is appreciated and ‘usability culture’ as an ideal state can be achieved; or 4) The organizational culture in question should be modified so that usability is appreciated and ‘usability culture’ as an ideal state can be achieved.*

**Quote:** *Communicating Design - Focus on what works • Ask lots of questions • Don’t claim to be the user • Let designers explain their decisions • Empower designers to make decisions • Use helpful language • Give designers what they need to be successful*

**Paper:** https://tidsskrift.dk/ashcc/article/view/21296/19618
**Quote:** *Human-computer interaction (HCI) is represented by a large and growing research community concerned with the study and design of interactive technologies. It rapidly emerged from the research labs of the 1970s, matching the lifetime of the Århus Decennial conferences.*
**Quote:** *For example, one position adopted by a key textbook—Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction formulates HCI as a contributing academic discipline to a broader field of interaction design.*
**Quote:** *for work that evaluates novel input or output devices, but also for innovative interaction techniques for established interface forms (e.g., GUIs, touch and gestural interfaces, etc.). The ‘ideal expression’ of the scientific design space is often conducted under the broader glossed label of psychology. It characteristically involves engaging in task-oriented interface evaluations via a hypothesis-driven experimental format—being often classed as ‘usability evaluation’*
**Quote:** *“Design is thus a well-established and widespread approach in HCI research, but one which tends to become concealed under conservative covers of theory dependence, fieldwork data, user testing, and rigorous evaluations”*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220725027_FLOSS_UX_Design_An_Analysis_of_User_Experience_Design_in_Firefox_and_OpenOfficeorg
**Quote:** *A UX designer has to present rationale. On one hand, the designer should be trusted to come up with appropriate designs for the community to experiment with. On the other hand, designers should provide rationale based on science. Of course, these two approaches are not mutually exclusive. They both occur to some extend in the community depending on the designer’s reputation.
Design thinking*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220725027_FLOSS_UX_Design_An_Analysis_of_User_Experience_Design_in_Firefox_and_OpenOfficeorg
**Quote:** *The community was encouraged to participate in the planning and design through two discussion groups. The development team and the UX team participated in the discussions addressing concerns amongst each other and with the community of users.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378172745_Facilitating_students'_design_thinking_skills_in_science_class_an_exploratory_study
**Quote:** *With the promotion of STEM education, the connection of design tasks/projects with students’ design thinking become obvious and important. For instance, Wingard et al. (2022) used a qualitative approach to examine 22 individuals who participated in a STEM-related design thinking course and found that the course improved students’ STEM self-efficacy and design thinking skills.*

**Quote:** *We adopted a comprehensive design thinking teaching model developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Teaching Systems Lab. This model consists of Discover, Focus, Imagine, Prototype, Try, Reflect & Share. It encourages students to solve problems and create artifacts based on their own cognitive experiences and multiple design thinking skills derived from real-world problem situations.*

**Quote:** *The concept of design thinking can be categorised into three distinct perspectives. Firstly, design thinking can be viewed as a set of methodologies that prioritise a human-centred approach to problem-solving. This approach aims to create innovative solutions that address the needs and desires of the end-user (Brown, 2008). Secondly, design thinking can be seen as a mindset, where individuals approach problem-solving with a designer’s perspective, focusing on the process rather than a beautifully designed or practical end result (Dunne & Martin, 2006). Finally, design thinking can be perceived as a process of innovation, which involves continuous ideation, prototyping, evaluation, and iteration to ﬁnd effective solutions to complex problems (Araújo et al., 2015; Goldman et al., 2014; Razzouk & Shute, 2012).
Design terminology, labels and roles.*

**Paper:** https://tidsskrift.dk/ashcc/article/view/21296/19618
**Quote:** *Many early fundamental interaction techniques were initially conceived of in this way (e.g., direct manipulation, the mouse, windowing environments—i.e., as primordially technological engineering endeavours that aimed to produce task-functional and efficient user interfaces…a pairing between design work and cognitive scientific work. Norman described this as “cognitive engineering”*

**Quote:** *“micro-HCI”, where researchers “design and build innovative interfaces and deliver validated guidelines for use across the range of desktop, Web, mobile, and ubiquitous devices”, and “macro-HCI”, which deals with “expanding areas, such as affective experience, aesthetics, motivation, social participation, trust, empathy, responsibility, and privacy”. Macro and micro HCI have “healthy overlaps” yet have different “metrics and evaluation methods”.*

**Paper:** https://www.igi-global.com/gateway/article/170474
**Quote:** *The role of the product designer, stating: the designer is increasingly becoming the one that designs the process that will allow the user herself to become a final product designer (Cicero, 2013). On the other hand, LaBarre (2010) discusses open-source workshops available to teach people how to create their own products using OSTs. Research agrees that the role of the designer is set to shift, with the potential for people to make/modify their own designs at home.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220725027_FLOSS_UX_Design_An_Analysis_of_User_Experience_Design_in_Firefox_and_OpenOfficeorg
**Quote:** *User experience designers bring several different methodologies and theories to their practice. User experience design practice includes other design approaches such as user research, interaction design, and usability engineering, among others. These design approaches combine in various ways, depending on the audience and the product, to ensure a positive user experience. Not many open source projects engage in UX design, however, some projects do have particular UX strategies in place.
Determining where to start (eg. does a product already exist? are you starting from scratch?) visioning and goals.*

**Paper:** https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-maturity-model/
**Quote:** *The UX-maturity model provides a framework to assess each organization’s UX-related strengths and weaknesses. Regardless of your organization’s current UX activities, increasing understanding and self-awareness about your UX maturity can only improve and sustain the quality of your UX work and, ultimately, the experiences you create for your users. Even organizations performing at high UX-maturity levels benefit from assessing what works and why. This knowledge allows systemizing UX work to make it truly part of the organization’s DNA, so that good UX practices survive through big organizational changes.*

**Paper:** https://web.archive.org/web/20090625141639/http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2008/08/01/free-software-usability
**Quote:** *Coding before design. Software tends to be much more usable if it is, at least roughly, designed before the code is written. The desired human interface for a program or feature may affect the data model, the choice of algorithms, the order in which operations are performed, the need for threading, the format for storing data on disk, and even the feature set of the program as a whole. But doing all that wireframing and prototyping seems boring, so a programmer often just starts coding — they’ll worry about the interface later. But the more code has been written, the harder it is to fix a design problem — so programmers are more likely not to bother, or to convince themselves it isn’t really a problem. And if they finally fix the interface after version 1.0, existing users will have to relearn it, frustrating them and encouraging them to consider competing programs.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220725078_A_Survey_of_Usability_Practices_in_FreeLibreOpen_Source_Software
**Quote:** *The other projects also discuss the needs or effects of user research and usability. The GNOME, KDE and OpenOffice.org projects reported missing a shared vision of project goals or audience.
What good does user research/design do for OSS?*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220725078_A_Survey_of_Usability_Practices_in_FreeLibreOpen_Source_Software
**Quote:** *The GIMP project failed to identify clear project goals and a user focus early on. As a result, developers focused on user feature requests which resulted in irrelevant “feature creep”. This increased the complexity of the tool without providing an increased overall value. The project was forced to re-engineer the entire application and redefined the purpose and scope of the application.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221096187_Enabling_User_Centered_Design_Processes_in_Open_Source_Communities
**Quote:** *Before our intervention we found the development team framing their discussion of users as a discussion of the conflict between designing for “dumb end-users” or for highly skilled “administrator-users”. The survey and the associated discussion on the list suggest that our intervention pushed some developers’ attitude from antipathy towards empathy with end-users.*

**Paper:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3170427.3188395
**Quote:** *"I don’t have time to create an open-source project from my research." We believe that even a five-minute open-source release which solely consists of a project snapshot and a license file is better than none at all. In addition, this is likely due to the aforementioned "chicken-and-egg" problem. If the community would value these contributions as equal to a published paper - or better yet, as integral part of the publication - researchers would not consider the time spent preparing such a contribution as wasted.*

### Getting creative

**Paper:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3613904.3642686
**Quote:** *Design Cards can be inspirational tools and facilitate creativity when ideation becomes “unproductive”. Designers use cards to plan and guide formative and heuristic evaluation of design concepts and existing systems. Cards facilitate collaborative practices, such as discussion, turn-taking, and the exchange of ideas among team members. Further, design cards, such as responsible & inclusive (R&I) cards, support critical refections on broader impacts of designs…The cards also supported the design ideation by allowing participants to diverge from their unidirectional thinking while revealing domain specific issues they may not be aware of or consider when devising ideas.*

**Paper:** https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3166/jds.10.339-378
**Quote:** *We have assumed that the required level of creativity can be achieved by looking at a context much broader than the computer system itself. (in reference to building complex computational decision making systems)…the hypothesis that there exists a relationship between creativity, tacit knowledge, and contextualisation.*

### Quantitative Analytic methods to assess design e.g. A/B tests

**Paper:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581574
**Quote:** *OATutor was designed to be as modular and simple as possible in supporting randomized A/B testing. Researchers can conduct A/B testing by navigating to the desired logic within the source of the platform and inserting a conditional statement. Common A/B testing entry points exist in the platform as examples for researchers, such as A/B testing different BKT learning parameters and different tutoring pathways (Fig. 9). When a student visits OATutor, condition assignment is generated randomly and saved into the student’s browser. All subsequent student actions will then be logged with the current condition for future analysis.*

### Usability metrics - Resource: Superbloom’s SJAC usability scoring LINK TBC

**Paper:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581574
**Quote:** *Usage Statistics. Since the first deployment, the system has received over 70,000 problem submissions, of which 5,000 were from pilot courses - identified by the presence of a lms_user_id in the logs. Through these pilot courses at a local community college, we found 150 unique students using the system and 10 who had completed an entire course (predicted via their mastery). Thanks to our early adopters and educators, we have also been able to review nearly 2,000 pieces of feedback and subsequently made significant changes to the tutor and its content.*

**Paper:** http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI 2017/2exab/ea1135.pdf
**Quote:** *There has been no grand redesign of ILIAS. The quantifiable results of just over a year’s work do not seem particularly impressive - 130 entries for UI components governed by 361 guidelines, only 11 of which have been officially accepted, and only 69 of the 361 guidelines can be automatically tested thus far.*

### Qualitative - User research A stakeholder analysis or map

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220725078_A_Survey_of_Usability_Practices_in_FreeLibreOpen_Source_Software
**Quote:** *TYPO3 experienced the effect of a lack of community interest and participation. The usability team was organized and attempted to gather user research data through stake holder surveys to help create user groups and personas. They received poor participation from the community and were unable to complete the activity and so design efforts continued without valuable user research. They speculated that reasons for a lack of participation from the community were that the culture of getting work done may have surpassed the need for understanding their users needs and goals.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225140256_Major_HCI_Challenges_for_Open_Source_Software_Adoption_and_Development
**Quote:** *From the above case we can see that whenever the HCI principles were taken into consideration (cases b and c), the end result was more satisfying to the users. Furthermore, it is apparent that by involving the user into the design and development process the rest of the challenges may be addressed.*

**Paper:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3613904.3642686
**Quote:** *Participants described that the (design) cards helped them explore and contextualize the problem space. The (design)cards supported participants in structuring primary research for an unfamiliar domain of societal resilience to understand the stakeholders and inform their design decisions. The (design) cards facilitated participants to converge and define which problem to solve. Participants used the card content (e.g., questions and examples) as a ‘checklist’ to narrow down key stakeholders, aspects, pain points, and design directions for design.*

### User personas/User profiles

**Paper:** https://web.archive.org/web/20090625141639/http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2008/08/01/free-software-usability
**Quote:** *Scratching their own itch. Volunteer developers work on projects and features they are interested in, which usually means software that they are going to use themselves. Being software developers, they’re also power users.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220725078_A_Survey_of_Usability_Practices_in_FreeLibreOpen_Source_Software
**Quote:** *TV Browser reported not knowing enough about their users in order to make informed design decisions. This problem was identified early in the project due to their proactive inclusion of designers. A series of user surveys were conducted to help fill in gaps of information about the users.
It can be difficult to get started with user research and the ability to ask the right questions and draw useful conclusions requires experience. Defining user groups and personas takes guidance and experience. Usability engineers are necessary to help conduct user research studies such as surveys and interviews, and to help make sense of the data by summarizing it for developers in user groups and personas.*

**Paper:** https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/server/api/core/bitstreams/13b6d7ef-b40c-4ed2-b904-0db1121dec57/content
**Quote:** *helping them to try and see the use of their systems through the eyes of other people unlike themselves and their peers. In fact, for many more advanced OSS products, developers are indeed users…However when designing products for less technical users, all the traditional usability problems arise.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221096187_Enabling_User_Centered_Design_Processes_in_Open_Source_Communities
**Quote:** *we as researchers would have to get an understanding of the users and use situations. Then we would ask the ambassador participants to investigate their users and share their knowledge with the other developers. These were to be used as a basis for personas descriptions intended at the distributed development process. As part of the process of creating awareness of the users, we conducted a prestudy of the use of the TYPO3 CMS in two organizations differing in size, complexity of the TYPO3 system implemented, and the end-users’ possibilities for IT support. Four interviews and three videotaped observations were made. Talking to end-users and seeing them use the system provided insights about work, work situations, and attitudes. we asked the developers to consider what they knew about their endusers, and to submit written descriptions of actual end-users they had met. They immediately perceived the request for user descriptions as a request for descriptions of abstract user-types, which they denoted “personas” in their discussions. Taking a solution oriented approach the developers used these personas to describe solutions for the system. Later they were asked to interview a selection of users and four e-mail interviews were carried out but they also exposed a huge variation in the use of the CMS. Either it was used by novice users with a very limited set of functions on a less frequent basis, or by users with high computer skills, using a wide range of functionalities on a daily basis.*

### User Journeys/User Observation

**Paper:** https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/server/api/core/bitstreams/13b6d7ef-b40c-4ed2-b904-0db1121dec57/content
**Quote:** *An end user can volunteer a description of their own, perhaps idiosyncratic, experiences with the software. A person with some experience of usability can submit their analysis. Furthermore, such a contributor could run a user study with a sample size of one, and then report it. It is surprising how much usability information can be extracted from a small number of studies (Nielsen, 1993).*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266616572_Applying_user_journey_design_to_resolve_complex_design_problems
**Quote:** *User Journeys provide a structured approach to synthesizing large amounts of data in self-reflective, humanistic ways, where the path through complexity can be traced back from artifact to the original problem-formation. It is in this respect that User Journey Design not only provides an approach to solving problems that emerge through complexity, but also narrows the gap between practice, research and teaching.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221436739_User_research_in_a_scientific_software_development_project
**Quote:** *An approach combining a range of user-centred design activities was taken, including activities grounded in the social sciences, in particular ethnography, focusing on understanding the scientists and their work, to more conventional user-centred design activities focusing on evaluating the usability of the software itself – including expert usability inspections and user observations…These observations took place over periods of time ranging from 30 minutes to full days, mainly focusing on the work of an individual scientist, but also on occasion group activities, such as lab meetings or more informal social gatherings away from the lab. Notes were taken by hand; but audio and video recordings supplemented observations where activities became particularly complex, or where there was a particular need to record artifacts of the activity.*

**Quote:** *Insights into the extent to which scientists followed strict experimental protocols (i.e. sets of instructions for conducting an experiment), and when and why they might deviate from such protocols have helped to inform the development of OMERO’s Protocol Editor functionality. Edibility of stages of protocols is supported, enabling users to start with a template protocol and document deviations from or adaptations of this as required; although the inertia of encouraging potentially laborious data input for no immediate benefit is still to be fully addressed.*

### User testing, usability testing, user research contextual inquiry

**Paper:** https://web.archive.org/web/20090625141639/http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2008/08/01/free-software-usability
**Quote:** *Usability is hard to measure. Some qualities of software are easily and precisely measured: whether it runs at all, how fast it starts, how fast it runs, and whether it is technically correct. Without frequent user testing, volunteer projects rely on subjective feedback from the sort of people devoted enough to be subscribed to a project mailing list. But what these people say may not be representative of even their own actual behavior, let alone the behavior of users in general.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220725078_A_Survey_of_Usability_Practices_in_FreeLibreOpen_Source_Software
**Quote:** *The most common topic, and only topic reported by all eight FLOSS projects, was related to User Research. Methods was also a frequently cited topic (seven projects) and is closely related to the issues presented in the User Research topic.*

**Quote:** *It is significant that each FLOSS project experienced issues linked to user research so severe or valued the information provided by user research enough to indicate it in the case study. These findings support the general consensus among FLOSS usability leaders that the lack of user research has had a significant impact on FLOSS usability.*

**Paper:** https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/server/api/core/bitstreams/13b6d7ef-b40c-4ed2-b904-0db1121dec57/content
**Quote:** *A key positive factor is that some end users are involved in OSS projects (Feller and Fitzgerald, 2002, p. 93; Raymond, 1998). This involvement can be in elaborating requirements, testing, writing documentation, reporting bugs, requesting new features, etc. This is clearly in accord with the advocacy of HCI experts, e.g. Shneiderman (2002), and also has features in common with participatory design (Kyng and Mathiassen, 1997). The challenge is how to enable and encourage far greater participation of non-technical end users and HCI experts who do not conform to the traditional OSS-hacker stereotype.*

**Quote:** *Generally speaking most members [of an open source community] are Passive Members. For example about 99% of people who use Apache are Passive Users. (Nakakoji, 2002) One reason for users‟ non-participation is that the act of contributing is perceived as too costly compared to any benefits. The time and effort to register with Bugzilla (a pre-requisite for bug reporting) and understand its web interface are considerable. User-reported usability incidents are a strong candidate for addressing usability issues in OSS projects. That is, users reporting occasions when they have problems whilst they are using an application. Existing HCI research (Hartson and Castillo, 1998; Castillo et al., 1998) has shown, on a small scale, that user reporting is effective at identifying usability problems.*

### Resourcing and budgeting for usability and UX in science

https://www.nngroup.com/courses/advocating-resources-budget/

**Paper:** https://web.archive.org/web/20090625141639/http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2008/08/01/free-software-usability
**Quote:** *Design suggestions often aren’t invited or welcomed. Free Software has a long and healthy tradition of “show me the code”. But when someone points out a usability issue, this tradition turns into “patches welcome”, which is unhelpful since most designers aren’t programmers. And it’s not obvious how else usability specialists should help out. Solution: Establish a process for usability specialists to contribute to a project.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220725078_A_Survey_of_Usability_Practices_in_FreeLibreOpen_Source_Software
**Quote:** *FLOSS contributors are primarily developers, and it is easy for developers to assess the skill and competency of another developer through experience. It is difficult for usability engineers to prove themselves to developers in the same way since developers do not always understand the processes or results of usability activities. As a result, there is often tension and communication problems when usability engineers and developers try to work together. Trust must be established between the usability engineer and developer in order to have a successful usability relationship.*

**Quote:** *There is also a cultural issue of what it means to “do” and what activities are considered useful contributions. The TYPO3 project reported a failure in conducting a user research activity and speculated that the “culture of doing” was stronger than the “abstract notion” of understanding their users (which is a key component in creating usable products). Developers, who can count “doing” by lines of code or number of commits, simply did not see the value of abstract activities such as discussion and research.*

**Quote:** *The OpenUsability Season of Usability [21] is an internship program that provides design students an opportunity to work with a FLOSS project. Project mentors encourage their students to conduct user research as a part of the project. These activities help students understand the goals and users, begin the documentation process, and begin institutionalizing the idea of user research in the project they are working with.*

**Quote:** *A recent initiative by the KDE Usability Project are the KDE User Research Templates. This template provides an outline to document user research data such as a project vision, user types, primary functionality, and use cases. The goal is to help developers document important user information and make it accessible to project members with minimal reliance on usability engineers. Contributors to the KDE Usability Project then review the developer-generated documents and provide feedback.*

**Paper:** https://cc.oulu.fi/~mrajanen/OSS2015_rajanen_iivari.pdf
**Quote:** *The usability team conducted heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough and usability testing for the OSS and reported the findings in a report that was sent to the core developers and mentioned in a forum post at the main discussion forum of the community. The developers acknowledged receiving the report and said that they would respond when they had discussed it internally. After three years, no contact by the developers has been made, the identified usability problems have not been fixed and there has not been discussion about any usability related user interface changes in the forums.*

## Applying UX to science

### Data Heavy design

**Paper:** https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/server/api/core/bitstreams/13b6d7ef-b40c-4ed2-b904-0db1121dec57/content
**Quote:** *The decision to add multiple alternative options to a system may be seen as a positive good rather than an invidious compromise. We speculate that freedom of choice may be considered a desirable attribute (even a design aesthetic) by many OSS developers. The end result is an application that has many configuration options, allowing very sophisticated tailoring by expert users, but which can be bewildering to a novice (Nielsen, 1993, p. 12).*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345324219_Design_Considerations_for_Data-Driven_Dashboards_Supporting_Facilitation_Tasks_for_Open-Ended_Learning
**Quote:** *We guided the facilitators to discuss how they like to work with multiple visualizations, and we found using a “layered” structure could be a viable approach. There were three cases of this layered structure that emerged from the design sessions: (1) using a schematic of the exhibit that shows the global view and adding zoomed in layers that focus on a local biome; (2) using a multi-layer design where multiple concepts are represented on one visualization and the facilitators can choose which layer to work with; and (3) adding filters on one visualization to focus on a subset of data…Research shows that multi-layer designs can also enable users of complex systems to get started easily and progress at their own pace and according to their needs*

**Quote:** *Their preference for simple representations was as much about data literacy as about attention management: worries that they could not explain the representations to visitors, or even a lack of confidence in their own ability to interpret richer data visualizations while in the thick of managing the exhibit. To address this design challenge, we are considering forms of information that can be rapidly accessed, for example, automatic alerts to help facilitators monitor visitors and decide when to intervene (during an engagement phase), or representations that can easily be perceived.*

**Quote:** *When designing a data-driven dashboard, we have to be careful with visualizations that are perhaps unfamiliar, at least at first, and it is important to support a meaningful transition into and out of the tool.*

### Complex systems design → interoperable information, functions, data and visualisations

**Paper:** https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1018/939
**Quote:** *There is a tendency for OSS applications to grow in complexity, reducing their usability for novices, but with that tendency to remain invisible to the developers who are not novices and relish the power of sophisticated applications. Expert developers will also rarely encounter the default settings of a multiplicity of options and so are unlikely to give much attention to their careful selection, whereas novices will often live with those defaults. Of course commercial applications also grow in complexity, but at least there are some factors to moderate that growth, including the cost of developing the extra features and some pressures from a growing awareness of usability issues.*

**Quote:** *For functional bugs a tool such as Bugzilla works well in supporting developers, but presents complex interfaces to other potential contributors. If we wish such tools to be used by HCI people then they may need an alternative lightweight interface that abstracts away from some low-level details. In particular, systems that are built on top of code management systems can easily become overly focussed on textual elements.*

### How to make the process of inferring hypothesis/scientific discovery from a scientific UI

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345324219_Design_Considerations_for_Data-Driven_Dashboards_Supporting_Facilitation_Tasks_for_Open-Ended_Learning
**uote:** *The majority of learning dashboards are intended to deliver summative feedback … but some researchers have started exploring how dashboards can provide “formative feedback” to teachers so they can intervene in real time and during ongoing learning activities. However, a major facet of formative feedback often concerns the “correctness” of learner efforts, which is not readily defined or even useful for open-ended inquiry activities.*

**Quote:** *A key realization is that the design of dashboard should supply information in a way that supports “real-time task management” for the facilitators. In other words, the dashboard tool should not leave extra burden on facilitators to decide on information and action at any given time. Based on these insights, we are considering a “pragmatic sequencing” in our design. Similar to a “learning progression”.
Tech prototyping & Making*

### Paper and/or UI prototyping

**Paper:** https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/server/api/core/bitstreams/13b6d7ef-b40c-4ed2-b904-0db1121dec57/content
**Quote:** *Well run projects are meant to plan carefully in advance, capturing requirements and clearly specifying what should be done before ever beginning coding. By contrast OSS often appears to involve coding as early as possible, relying on constant review to refine and improve the overall, emergent design: “your nascent developer community needs to have something runnable and testable to play with‟ (Raymond, 1998). Similarly, Scacchi‟s (2002) … skipping much of the design stage with Mozilla resulted in design and requirements work occurring in bug reports, after the distribution of early versions. However good interface design works best by being involved before coding occurs. If there is no collective advance planning even for the coding, there is no opportunity to factor interface issues into the early design.*

**Paper:** https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1018/939
**Quote:** *Much usability discussion is graphical in nature and might be better supported through sketching and annotation functionality; it is noticeable that some Mozilla bug discussions include textual representations ('ASCII art') of proposed interface elements. Hartson and Castillo (1998) review various graphical approaches to bug reporting including video and screenshots which can supplement the predominant text-based methods.*

**Paper:** https://www.igi-global.com/gateway/article/170474
**Quote:** *Functional Prototypes: Do not look like a finished product but carry out the function as intended. Aesthetic Prototypes: Look almost as a perfect finished product, but may do not function as intended. Complete Products: A combination of functional and aesthetic prototypes. It performs the function as intended whilst resembling the desired design.*

### UI kits and Design systems (where STRUDEL can be highlighted)

**Paper:** https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/server/api/core/bitstreams/13b6d7ef-b40c-4ed2-b904-0db1121dec57/content
**Quote:** *Functionality problems are often easier to specify, evaluate and modularize than usability problems. These are all attributes which simplify decentralized problem solving. Usability problems can be much harder to describe and may pervade an entire screen, interaction or user experience. Incremental patches to interface bugs may be far less effective than incremental patches to functionality bugs. Fixing the problem may require a major overhaul of the entire interface – clearly not a small contribution to the ongoing design work. Involving more than one designer in interface design, particularly if they work autonomously, will lead to design inconsistency and hence lower the overall usability*

**Paper:** http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI2017/2exab/ea1135.pdf
**Quote:** *Creating a more consistent UI through small steps at the component level would in and of itself already increase the coherence and usability of the software, and would seem like a less daunting task for the developers, thereby increasing the chances of the changes being accepted and applied within the community. The first step was therefore to catalogue the existing UI components of ILIAS, and to make concrete proposals for improving the usability of those components at the micro, rather than the macro level. This resulted in a taxonomy containing over 130 entries, with a total of 361 guidelines for how to improve those components.*

**Quote:** *The Centralizing UI Components sub-project uses the generated taxonomy and guidelines to refactor the classes that render the UI. The outcome will be a framework that allows developers to ask for a UI component to be rendered by passing the required data, without them needing to know what the component actually looks like.
Usability heuristics*

**Paper:** https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/server/api/core/bitstreams/13b6d7ef-b40c-4ed2-b904-0db1121dec57/content
**Quote:** *Clear articulation of the underlying usability analysis, a kind of design rationale, may help. In the absence of such explanations, the danger is that a lone usability expert will be marginalized.
Paper:https://cc.oulu.fi/~mrajanen/OSS2015_rajanen_iivari.pdf*

**Quote:** *The usability team tutored the lead developer about the concept of usability and offered their assistance to all things related to usability, trying to get a legitimate position within the OSS project. The lead developer got interested in the possible benefits of better usability and identified several possible areas for usability evaluation. The usability team performed heuristic evaluation and usability testing for the OSS and was in close contact with the lead developer regarding their findings and possible redesign solutions, and also participated in discussions in the project’s IRC channel. After the evaluations, the usability team wrote a report of the usability issues, which included also their suggestions for changes to fix the usability problems. This time the work of the usability team had an impact. The core developers included the suggestions of the usability team as part of the changes to be made to the next version of the OSS and also fixed them in the next version. The core developers also contacted the usability team later, asking for a new usability evaluation for the next version.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221096187_Enabling_User_Centered_Design_Processes_in_Open_Source_Communities
**Quote:** *We introduced a set of heuristics in order to provide the participants on the mailing list with a common vocabulary for usability, supposing that having some form of contextually relevant knowledge on usability, equally available to all developers, would set some form of reflection upon enduser issues in motion. (HCI) discussions lapse towards either specific problems (e.g. labelling of functionality), towards paradigmatic observations of a very general nature (e.g. are we “dumbing the system down” or are we making it smarter?), or towards ethical paradoxes inherent in open source development (e.g. why care about users at all when you do things for free?). We tentatively introduced 10 heuristics (see wiki.typo3.org/index.php/Heuristics) A shared vocabulary and some basic knowledge of more abstracted concepts in understanding how users interact with systems, so we expected, would raise the bar for the discussions on the list and potentially make the problems discovered eligible for shared solutions rather than the unsystematic and narrow focus of solving “one-off” particular problems.*

### Design QA/Iterating on design

**Paper:**https://cc.oulu.fi/~mrajanen/OSS2015_rajanen_iivari.pdf
**Quote:** *One of the members of the usability team was invited to the development team and given commit rights as a result of his work in the usability team, his contributions to the code and discussions, and his recognized skills as a user of the OSS. The development team of this OSS project was a tight group, who promoted into their team only those contributors who had contributed high level code, bug fixes or designs for a long period of time and whose ideas were in line with the design philosophy of the developers and the community. The development team made all decisions after lengthy discussions, trying to achieve a consensus.*

**Paper:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3613904.3642686
**Quote:** *The (design) cards could be used as a checklist to re-evaluate assumptions and designs after the first round of ideation. Participants shared that the cards supported them in revisiting their design decisions to include unanticipated perspectives and edge cases. For instance, WP3 found the questions on the cards could help to iterate over the initial designs.*

## Advanced topics

### Product Strategy/Management enables design and design enables product strategy/management

**Resources:** https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNIKYM6U=/

**Paper:** https://web.archive.org/web/20090625141639/http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2008/08/01/free-software-usability
**Quote:** *Design is high-bandwidth, the Net is low-bandwidth. Volunteer software projects are usually highly distributed, with contributors in different cities or even different continents. So project communications are mostly plain text, in e-mail, instant messaging, IRC, or a bug tracking system. But interaction design is multi-dimensional, involving the layout and behavior of elements over time, and the organization of those elements in an overall interface. When developers are in the same room, they can discuss interaction design using whiteboards, paper prototypes, spoken words, and gestures. But on the Internet, these often aren’t available, making discussions much slower and prone to misunderstandings.*

**Paper:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581574
**Quote:** *Through a research-through-design methodology, we gathered three main takeaways from our stakeholder groups. First, OATutor demonstrates basic usability as a system that teachers can use for students to supplement their knowledge base. T1 continued using OATutor for six terms without incentives from the team and continues to use the system to date. Second, our authoring system is reasonably efficient for authors to transcribe content. In the OATutor content authors survey, responses (N=15) indicated that authors take 2.27 hours (with a standard deviation of 1.10) for training and 11.03 minutes (with a standard deviation of 9.11) for creating each problem. Both training and creation times are in line with ASSISTments. Third, OATutor is researcher-friendly in providing an easily adoptable platform for researchers to conduct experimentation with. R1’s project improved log files and R2’s project improved KC model files for future researchers’ analyses (see section 3.2). R3’s research use case demonstrated OATutor’s extensibility with respect to A/B testing of experimental dynamic hint generation strategies.*


### Accessibility

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221096187_Enabling_User_Centered_Design_Processes_in_Open_Source_Communities
**Quote:** *In this way, innovation in the OSS community does not extend across the boundary into the context of those users who use the systems on a daily basis for mundane and leisurely task. Correspondingly, knowledge of end-user situations can not be seen to play any significant role in the development of the system and potentially not arriving at end-user friendly products can pose a serious threat to popularity and adoption of the system.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225140256_Major_HCI_Challenges_for_Open_Source_Software_Adoption_and_Development
**Quote:** *the embodiment of accessibility in OSS design; currently we see a move towards the inclusion of accessibility features into systems, tools and the programming languages themselves as system wide core functionalities (e.g. KDE, GNONE and Java Accessibility). To respond to such a requirement Crombie et al argue for the need of a unifying and inclusive approach to open source information systems and introduce the so called “(Open Source) Accessible Information Process ing” approach. The aim of such an approach is to synchronize various efforts in the accessibility arena and offer them to end-users and business as a ‘package’. This package would include explicit knowledge about the exact requirements and implementation of these requirements as practical and re-usable approached that codify accessible information. Their usage by the community will be continually fed back (communication from scratch concept).*

**Paper:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581574
**Quote:** *In an effort to make our system accessible to all users who wish to learn or conduct research with our platform, we have ensured that every page complies with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (level AA) and the federal Revised Section 508 Standards. To do this, the website is composed of modular components that were built to be accessible…Going beyond the codified accessibility standards, our system incorporates many of the modern best practices for complex input transformations, dynamic content notifications, and error handling. Since users are able to enter mathematical symbols, operands, and matrices.*

### Community building

**Paper:** https://cc.oulu.fi/~mrajanen/OSS2015_rajanen_iivari.pdf
**Quote:** *The adhocratic culture type is the most suitable culture type for usability work in the OSS development context…when aiming at introducing usability work into OSS development; it needs to be modified to fit the culture type.*

**Paper:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581574
**Quote:** *Our system utilizes an aspect of crowdsourcing bordering on the definition of learner sourcing to create a sustainable content-authoring environment. Our process involves the recruitment of qualified learners to help with content curation of the desired respective subject…After a learner has been recruited as a content creator, they undergo an introductory training course, consisting of an introduction to the system, a video guide on how to create problems, and an introductory “assignment” asking the creator to make five sample problems. The goal of the course is to prepare creators for their task in a time-efficient manner, while providing them with a hands-on introduction to the system through the sample problems. In order to focus on fostering a healthy content curation environment, the content team held weekly half-hour meetings. This allowed authoring issues to be voiced and gave the opportunity for editors to directly respond to questions from the content creators. Additionally, the community building that took place fostered a collaborative crowdsourcing environment.*

### Progressive enhancement design

**Paper:** https://repository.uel.ac.uk/download/c0d3a9ac96b03992e54a78828e4e86c3695f5e88c2cf38556597a6b1216836b9/289029/Wells%2C J. (2007) HT 55-6.pdf
**Quote:** *Progressive Enhancement is a modern approach for developing web documents that are accessible across any browser or device that has access to the Internet. Based on the idea of separating a document’s content, presentation, and behaviour, progressive enhancement embraces accessibility, semantics, forward compatibility and usability.*

**Quote:** *The progressive enhancement approach could be loosely considered as an application of the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern [6]. In this scenario, the data embedded in the content layer represents the model, and the browser software represents the controller.*

**Paper:** https://elifesciences.org/labs/e5737fd5/designing-progressive-enhancement-into-the-academic-manuscript
**Quote:** *The ideal presentation of a research artefact should therefore coax the user into increasingly higher levels of engagement, with a particular focus on providing the user with the just right level of context to bridge the delicate transition from partial to full engagement…We also don’t want to assume the above behaviour progression is always true: a user could for instance be looking for a specific example of a method, figure or result across multiple papers, and may not be interested in each manuscript’s narrative as a whole.*

### Service design when science and research becomes publicly accessed

**Paper:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3613904.3642686
**Quote:** *From our own research, we selected the SpaceActivity (SA) framework [59] to explore how translational design cards prompt designers to think about spaces in their designs for societal resilience…Space-Activity (SA) framework [59]. The framework provides a classification of spaces and activities to reflect on adaptations in response to a crisis. The framework contains three key dimensions: (1) space, (2) activity, and (3) elements of space. The space dimension is divided into public and private spaces. Home spaces are private spaces, whereas publicly accessible spaces (e.g., parks, theatres, grocery shops, etc.) are public spaces. The horizontal axis denotes the activity dimension. The activity dimension comprises individual, and co-located activities…In-person co-located activities include social interactions and activities that people perform with others while present in the same physical space.*


**Paper:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502128
**Quote:** *'Service design can be define as' The change of the design context from end-users to multiple stakeholders, the change of design object from a single product to a network of multiple touch points, and the change of the impact scope from user experience to a socio-economic system. Service design was recognized as a potential approach to offer logic, approaches and tools to HCI to respond to these changes…Service design emerged in management and operations studies in the 1980s as an approach to manage the quality of service and develop new services based on the customer need. It has been adopted and developed in different fields, including design research, system engineering, information system science, interaction design and so on.*


**Quote:** *Service design with this perspective, focuses to create a platform or a condition for value co-creation by engaging multiple stakeholders. Identifying relevant stakeholders to bring value in and creating their collaborative networks are primary goals of this notion of service design…“Tangible Ecosystem Design” that incorporates business transactions, platform capabilities and external contexts (e.g. policy), to design for software ecosystem. (Could be OSS)*

### Bridging the gap between Science/Research (methods), OSS and design practice

**Paper:** https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2024/program/content/147574
**Quote:** *Research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) often provides design implications, guidelines, models, or frameworks to guide the design of products and services. Although academic research insights are informative for design, HCI practitioners often struggle to apply research findings in their design practices. Practitioners find academically oriented guidelines and frameworks too abstract, jargon-laden, inaccessible, and not detailed enough to prompt the appropriation of research insights into their workflow in industries. These barriers limit the impact of the work of academic researchers. Both practitioners and researchers fail to benefit from each other’s skills and knowledge, creating a gap between academic research and design practice…Findings suggest that the design cards support designers to make sense of the research insights and apply the knowledge in the design process. The work makes the following contributions to the research community.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220725027_FLOSS_UX_Design_An_Analysis_of_User_Experience_Design_in_Firefox_and_OpenOfficeorg
**Quote:** *UX practitioners often have to coordinate activities among various stakeholders (e.g. users, developers, and managers), social interactions can be challenging and particularly in FLOSS environments where UX activities are unfamiliar. In the highly distributed FLOSS development environment, activity awareness provides facets that aid in capturing the dynamics of social interaction where FLOSS developers work on complex projects over long spans of time.*

**Quote:** *At first glance UX design is not easy to recognize. Design work is carried out in discussion lists, bug trackers, and requirements documents. No obvious single design space exists, whereas, code exists in repositories and is easy to download and work with.*

#Core Topics

## Foundations of Design

### What is design? (in the context of OSS)

**Paper:** https://cc.oulu.fi/~mrajanen/OSS2015_rajanen_iivari.pdf
**Quote:** *It seems that there may be a cultural clash or conflict between usability work and engineering culture as well as between usability work and culture of some particular development organizations. To solve the problem of cultural clash or conflict, researchers suggest that: 1) Usability work should be modified to fit the engineering culture; 2) Usability work should be modified to fit some particular organizational culture; 3) Engineering culture should be modified so that usability is appreciated and ‘usability culture’ as an ideal state can be achieved; or 4) The organizational culture in question should be modified so that usability is appreciated and ‘usability culture’ as an ideal state can be achieved.*

**Paper:** http://events17.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/ApacheCon_EU_2016_victoria_bondarchuk_0.pdf
**Quote:** *Communicating Design - Focus on what works • Ask lots of questions • Don’t claim to be the user • Let designers explain their decisions • Empower designers to make decisions • Use helpful language • Give designers what they need to be successful*

### Design terminology, labels and roles

**Paper:**
**Quote:**

### Determining where to start (eg. does a product already exist? are you starting from scratch?) visioning and goals.
**Paper/Article:** https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-maturity-model/
**Quote:** *The UX-maturity model provides a framework to assess each organization’s UX-related strengths and weaknesses. Regardless of your organization’s current UX activities, increasing understanding and self-awareness about your UX maturity can only improve and sustain the quality of your UX work and, ultimately, the experiences you create for your users. Even organizations performing at high UX-maturity levels benefit from assessing what works and why. This knowledge allows systemizing UX work to make it truly part of the organization’s DNA, so that good UX practices survive through big organizational changes.*

**Paper:** https://web.archive.org/web/20090625141639/http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2008/08/01/free-software-usability
**Quote:** *Coding before design. Software tends to be much more usable if it is, at least roughly, designed before the code is written. The desired human interface for a program or feature may affect the data model, the choice of algorithms, the order in which operations are performed, the need for threading, the format for storing data on disk, and even the feature set of the program as a whole. But doing all that wireframing and prototyping seems boring, so a programmer often just starts coding — they’ll worry about the interface later. But the more code has been written, the harder it is to fix a design problem — so programmers are more likely not to bother, or to convince themselves it isn’t really a problem. And if they finally fix the interface after version 1.0, existing users will have to relearn it, frustrating them and encouraging them to consider competing programs.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220725078_A_Survey_of_Usability_Practices_in_FreeLibreOpen_Source_Software
**Quote:** *The other projects also discuss the needs or effects of user research and usability. The GNOME, KDE and OpenOffice.org projects reported missing a shared vision of project goals or audience.*

### What good does user research/design do for OSS?

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220725078_A_Survey_of_Usability_Practices_in_FreeLibreOpen_Source_Software
**Quote:** *The GIMP project failed to identify clear project goals and a user focus early on. As a result, developers focused on user feature requests which resulted in irrelevant “feature creep”. This increased the complexity of the tool without providing an increased overall value. The project was forced to re-engineer the entire application and redefined the purpose and scope of the application.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221096187_Enabling_User_Centered_Design_Processes_in_Open_Source_Communities
**Quote:** *Before our intervention we found the development team framing their discussion of users as a discussion of the conflict between designing for “dumb end-users” or for highly skilled “administrator-users”. The survey and the associated discussion on the list suggest that our intervention pushed some developers’ attitude from antipathy towards empathy with end-users.*

**Paper:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3170427.3188395
**Quote:** *"I don’t have time to create an open-source project from my research." We believe that even a five-minute open-source release which solely consists of a project snapshot and a license file is better than none at all. In addition, this is likely due to the aforementioned "chicken-and-egg" problem. If the community would value these contributions as equal to a published paper - or better yet, as integral part of the publication - researchers would not consider the time spent preparing such a contribution as wasted.*

### Getting creative

### Quantitative - Analytic methods to assess design

**Paper:**
**Quote:**

### Usability metrics

**Resource:** SJAC usability scoring
**Paper:**
**Quote:**

### Qualitative - User research

A stakeholder analysis or map

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220725078_A_Survey_of_Usability_Practices_in_FreeLibreOpen_Source_Software

**Quote:** *TYPO3 experienced the effect of a lack of community interest and participation. The usability team was organized and attempted to gather user research data through stake holder surveys to help create user groups and personas. They received poor participation from the community and were unable to complete the activity and so design efforts continued without valuable user research. They speculated that reasons for a lack of participation from the community were that the culture of getting work done may have surpassed the need for understanding their users needs and goals.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225140256_Major_HCI_Challenges_for_Open_Source_Software_Adoption_and_Development
**Quote:** *From the above case we can see that whenever the HCI principles were taken into consideration (cases b and c), the end result was more satisfying to the users. Furthermore, it is apparent that by involving the user into the design and development process the rest of the challenges may be addressed.
User personas/User profiles*

**Paper:** https://web.archive.org/web/20090625141639/http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2008/08/01/free-software-usability
**Quote:** *Scratching their own itch. Volunteer developers work on projects and features they are interested in, which usually means software that they are going to use themselves. Being software developers, they’re also power users.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220725078_A_Survey_of_Usability_Practices_in_FreeLibreOpen_Source_Software
**Quote:** *TV Browser reported not knowing enough about their users in order to make informed design decisions. This problem was identified early in the project due to their proactive inclusion of designers. A series of user surveys were conducted to help fill in gaps of information about the users.
It can be difficult to get started with user research and the ability to ask the right questions and draw useful conclusions requires experience. Defining user groups and personas takes guidance and experience. Usability engineers are necessary to help conduct user research studies such as surveys and interviews, and to help make sense of the data by summarizing it for developers in user groups and personas.*

**Paper:** https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/server/api/core/bitstreams/13b6d7ef-b40c-4ed2-b904-0db1121dec57/content
**Quote:** *helping them to try and see the use of their systems through the eyes of other people unlike themselves and their peers. In fact, for many more advanced OSS products, developers are indeed users…However when designing products for less technical users, all the traditional usability problems arise.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221096187_Enabling_User_Centered_Design_Processes_in_Open_Source_Communities
**Quote:** *we as researchers would have to get an understanding of the users and use situations. Then we would ask the ambassador participants to investigate their users and share their knowledge with the other developers. These were to be used as a basis for personas descriptions intended at the distributed development process. As part of the process of creating awareness of the users, we conducted a prestudy of the use of the TYPO3 CMS in two organizations differing in size, complexity of the TYPO3 system implemented, and the end-users’ possibilities for IT support. Four interviews and three videotaped observations were made. Talking to end-users and seeing them use the system provided insights about work, work situations, and attitudes. we asked the developers to consider what they knew about their endusers, and to submit written descriptions of actual end-users they had met. They immediately perceived the request for user descriptions as a request for descriptions of abstract user-types, which they denoted “personas” in their discussions. Taking a solution oriented approach the developers used these personas to describe solutions for the system. Later they were asked to interview a selection of users and four e-mail interviews were carried out but they also exposed a huge variation in the use of the CMS. Either it was used by novice users with a very limited set of functions on a less frequent basis, or by users with high computer skills, using a wide range of functionalities on a daily basis.*


### User Journeys

**Paper:** https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/server/api/core/bitstreams/13b6d7ef-b40c-4ed2-b904-0db1121dec57/content
**Quote:** *An end user can volunteer a description of their own, perhaps idiosyncratic, experiences with the software. A person with some experience of usability can submit their analysis. Furthermore, such a contributor could run a user study with a sample size of one, and then report it. It is surprising how much usability information can be extracted from a small number of studies (Nielsen, 1993).*


### User testing, usability testing, user research contextual inquiry

**Quote:** *Usability is hard to measure. Some qualities of software are easily and precisely measured: whether it runs at all, how fast it starts, how fast it runs, and whether it is technically correct. Without frequent user testing, volunteer projects rely on subjective feedback from the sort of people devoted enough to be subscribed to a project mailing list. But what these people say may not be representative of even their own actual behavior, let alone the behavior of users in general.*

**Quote:** *The most common topic, and only topic reported by all eight FLOSS projects, was related to User Research. Methods was also a frequently cited topic (seven projects) and is closely related to the issues presented in the User Research topic.*

**Quote:** *It is significant that each FLOSS project experienced issues linked to user research so severe or valued the information provided by user research enough to indicate it in the case study. These findings support the general consensus among FLOSS usability leaders that the lack of user research has had a significant impact on FLOSS usability.*

**Quote:** *A key positive factor is that some end users are involved in OSS projects (Feller and Fitzgerald, 2002, p. 93; Raymond, 1998). This involvement can be in elaborating requirements, testing, writing documentation, reporting bugs, requesting new features, etc. This is clearly in accord with the advocacy of HCI experts, e.g. Shneiderman (2002), and also has features in common with participatory design (Kyng and Mathiassen, 1997). The challenge is how to enable and encourage far greater participation of non-technical end users and HCI experts who do not conform to the traditional OSS-hacker stereotype.*

**Quote:** *Generally speaking most members [of an open source community] are Passive Members. For example about 99% of people who use Apache are Passive Users. (Nakakoji, 2002) One reason for users‟ non-participation is that the act of contributing is perceived as too costly compared to any benefits. The time and effort to register with Bugzilla (a pre-requisite for bug reporting) and understand its web interface are considerable. User-reported usability incidents are a strong candidate for addressing usability issues in OSS projects. That is, users reporting occasions when they have problems whilst they are using an application. Existing HCI research (Hartson and Castillo, 1998; Castillo et al., 1998) has shown, on a small scale, that user reporting is effective at identifying usability problems.*

### Resourcing and budgeting for usability and UX in science

https://www.nngroup.com/courses/advocating-resources-budget/

**Paper:** https://web.archive.org/web/20090625141639/http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2008/08/01/free-software-usability
**Quote:** *Design suggestions often aren’t invited or welcomed. Free Software has a long and healthy tradition of “show me the code”. But when someone points out a usability issue, this tradition turns into “patches welcome”, which is unhelpful since most designers aren’t programmers. And it’s not obvious how else usability specialists should help out. Solution: Establish a process for usability specialists to contribute to a project.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220725078_A_Survey_of_Usability_Practices_in_FreeLibreOpen_Source_Software
**Quote:** *FLOSS contributors are primarily developers, and it is easy for developers to assess the skill and competency of another developer through experience. It is difficult for usability engineers to prove themselves to developers in the same way since developers do not always understand the processes or results of usability activities. As a result, there is often tension and communication problems when usability engineers and developers try to work together. Trust must be established between the usability engineer and developer in order to have a successful usability relationship.*

**Quote:** *There is also a cultural issue of what it means to “do” and what activities are considered useful contributions. The TYPO3 project reported a failure in conducting a user research activity and speculated that the “culture of doing” was stronger than the “abstract notion” of understanding their users (which is a key component in creating usable products). Developers, who can count “doing” by lines of code or number of commits, simply did not see the value of abstract activities such as discussion and research.*

**Quote:** *The OpenUsability Season of Usability [21] is an internship program that provides design students an opportunity to work with a FLOSS project. Project mentors encourage their students to conduct user research as a part of the project. These activities help students understand the goals and users, begin the documentation process, and begin institutionalizing the idea of user research in the project they are working with.*

**Quote:** *A recent initiative by the KDE Usability Project are the KDE User Research Templates. This template provides an outline to document user research data such as a project vision, user types, primary functionality, and use cases. The goal is to help developers document important user information and make it accessible to project members with minimal reliance on usability engineers. Contributors to the KDE Usability Project then review the developer-generated documents and provide feedback.*

**Paper:** https://cc.oulu.fi/~mrajanen/OSS2015_rajanen_iivari.pdf
**Quote:** *The usability team conducted heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough and usability testing for the OSS and reported the findings in a report that was sent to the core developers and mentioned in a forum post at the main discussion forum of the community. The developers acknowledged receiving the report and said that they would respond when they had discussed it internally. After three years, no contact by the developers has been made, the identified usability problems have not been fixed and there has not been discussion about any usability related user interface changes in the forums.*

### Applying UX to science - Data Heavy design

**Paper:** https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/server/api/core/bitstreams/13b6d7ef-b40c-4ed2-b904-0db1121dec57/content
**Quote:** *the decision to add multiple alternative options to a system may be seen as a positive good rather than an invidious compromise. We speculate that freedom of choice may be considered a desirable attribute (even a design aesthetic) by many OSS developers. The end result is an application that has many configuration options, allowing very sophisticated tailoring by expert users, but which can be bewildering to a novice (Nielsen, 1993, p. 12).*

### Complex systems design → interoperable information, functions, data and visualisations

**Paper:** https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1018/939
**Quote:** *There is a tendency for OSS applications to grow in complexity, reducing their usability for novices, but with that tendency to remain invisible to the developers who are not novices and relish the power of sophisticated applications. Expert developers will also rarely encounter the default settings of a multiplicity of options and so are unlikely to give much attention to their careful selection, whereas novices will often live with those defaults. Of course commercial applications also grow in complexity, but at least there are some factors to moderate that growth, including the cost of developing the extra features and some pressures from a growing awareness of usability issues.*

**Quote:** *For functional bugs a tool such as Bugzilla works well in supporting developers, but presents complex interfaces to other potential contributors. If we wish such tools to be used by HCI people then they may need an alternative lightweight interface that abstracts away from some low-level details. In particular, systems that are built on top of code management systems can easily become overly focussed on textual elements.*

### Tech prototyping & Making - Paper and/or UI prototyping

**Paper:** https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/server/api/core/bitstreams/13b6d7ef-b40c-4ed2-b904-0db1121dec57/content
**Quote:** *Well run projects are meant to plan carefully in advance, capturing requirements and clearly specifying what should be done before ever beginning coding. By contrast OSS often appears to involve coding as early as possible, relying on constant review to refine and improve the overall, emergent design: “your nascent developer community needs to have something runnable and testable to play with‟ (Raymond, 1998). Similarly, Scacchi‟s (2002) … skipping much of the design stage with Mozilla resulted in design and requirements work occurring in bug reports, after the distribution of early versions. However good interface design works best by being involved before coding occurs. If there is no collective advance planning even for the coding, there is no opportunity to factor interface issues into the early design.*

**Paper:** https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1018/939
**Quote:**  *Much usability discussion is graphical in nature and might be better supported through sketching and annotation functionality; it is noticeable that some Mozilla bug discussions include textual representations ('ASCII art') of proposed interface elements. Hartson and Castillo (1998) review various graphical approaches to bug reporting including video and screenshots which can supplement the predominant text-based methods.*

### UI kits and Design systems (where STRUDEL can be highlighted)

**Paper:** https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/server/api/core/bitstreams/13b6d7ef-b40c-4ed2-b904-0db1121dec57/content
**Quote:** *Functionality problems are often easier to specify, evaluate and modularize than usability problems. These are all attributes which simplify decentralized problem solving. Usability problems can be much harder to describe and may pervade an entire screen, interaction or user experience. Incremental patches to interface bugs may be far less effective than incremental patches to functionality bugs. Fixing the problem may require a major overhaul of the entire interface – clearly not a small contribution to the ongoing design work. Involving more than one designer in interface design, particularly if they work autonomously, will lead to design inconsistency and hence lower the overall usability*

### Usability heuristics

**Paper:** https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/server/api/core/bitstreams/13b6d7ef-b40c-4ed2-b904-0db1121dec57/content
**Quote:** *Clear articulation of the underlying usability analysis, a kind of design rationale, may help. In the absence of such explanations, the danger is that a lone usability expert will be marginalized.*

**Paper:** https://cc.oulu.fi/~mrajanen/OSS2015_rajanen_iivari.pdf
**Quote:** *The usability team tutored the lead developer about the concept of usability and offered their assistance to all things related to usability, trying to get a legitimate position within the OSS project. The lead developer got interested in the possible benefits of better usability and identified several possible areas for usability evaluation. The usability team performed heuristic evaluation and usability testing for the OSS and was in close contact with the lead developer regarding their findings and possible redesign solutions, and also participated in discussions in the project’s IRC channel. After the evaluations, the usability team wrote a report of the usability issues, which included also their suggestions for changes to fix the usability problems. This time the work of the usability team had an impact. The core developers included the suggestions of the usability team as part of the changes to be made to the next version of the OSS and also fixed them in the next version. The core developers also contacted the usability team later, asking for a new usability evaluation for the next version.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221096187_Enabling_User_Centered_Design_Processes_in_Open_Source_Communities
**Quote:** *We introduced a set of heuristics in order to provide the participants on the mailing list with a common vocabulary for usability, supposing that having some form of contextually relevant knowledge on usability, equally available to all developers, would set some form of reflection upon enduser issues in motion. (HCI) discussions lapse towards either specific problems (e.g. labelling of functionality), towards paradigmatic observations of a very general nature (e.g. are we “dumbing the system down” or are we making it smarter?), or towards ethical paradoxes inherent in open source development (e.g. why care about users at all when you do things for free?). We tentatively introduced 10 heuristics (see wiki.typo3.org/index.php/Heuristics) A shared vocabulary and some basic knowledge of more abstracted concepts in understanding how users interact with systems, so we expected, would raise the bar for the discussions on the list and potentially make the problems discovered eligible for shared solutions rather than the unsystematic and narrow focus of solving “one-off” particular problems.*

### Design QA/iterative design

**Paper:** https://cc.oulu.fi/~mrajanen/OSS2015_rajanen_iivari.pdf
**Quote:** *One of the members of the usability team was invited to the development team and given commit rights as a result of his work in the usability team, his contributions to the code and discussions, and his recognized skills as a user of the OSS. The development team of this OSS project was a tight group, who promoted into their team only those contributors who had contributed high level code, bug fixes or designs for a long period of time and whose ideas were in line with the design philosophy of the developers and the community. The development team made all decisions after lengthy discussions, trying to achieve a consensus.*

**Paper:** https://web.archive.org/web/20090625141639/http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2008/08/01/free-software-usability
**Quote:** *Design is high-bandwidth, the Net is low-bandwidth. Volunteer software projects are usually highly distributed, with contributors in different cities or even different continents. So project communications are mostly plain text, in e-mail, instant messaging, IRC, or a bug tracking system. But interaction design is multi-dimensional, involving the layout and behavior of elements over time, and the organization of those elements in an overall interface. When developers are in the same room, they can discuss interaction design using whiteboards, paper prototypes, spoken words, and gestures. But on the Internet, these often aren’t available, making discussions much slower and prone to misunderstandings.*

### Accessibility

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221096187_Enabling_User_Centered_Design_Processes_in_Open_Source_Communities
**Quote:** *In this way, innovation in the OSS community does not extend across the boundary into the context of those users who use the systems on a daily basis for mundane and leisurely task. Correspondingly, knowledge of end-user situations can not be seen to play any significant role in the development of the system and potentially not arriving at end-user friendly products can pose a serious threat to popularity and adoption of the system.*

**Paper:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225140256_Major_HCI_Challenges_for_Open_Source_Software_Adoption_and_Development
**Quote:** *the embodiment of accessibility in OSS design; currently we see a move towards the inclusion of accessibility features into systems, tools and the programming languages themselves as system wide core functionalities (e.g. KDE, GNONE and Java Accessibility). To respond to such a requirement Crombie et al argue for the need of a unifying and inclusive approach to open source information systems and introduce the so called “(Open Source) Accessible Information Process ing” approach. The aim of such an approach is to synchronize various efforts in the accessibility arena and offer them to end-users and business as a ‘package’. This package would include explicit knowledge about the exact requirements and implementation of these requirements as practical and re-usable approached that codify accessible information. Their usage by the community will be continually fed back (communication from scratch concept).*

### Community building
